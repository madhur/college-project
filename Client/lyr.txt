Razors edge
Outlines the dead
Incisions in my head
Anticipation the stimulation
To kill the exhilaration

(chorus:)
[part 1]
Close your eyes
Look deep in your soul
Step outside yourself
And let your mind go
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die

[part 2]
Close your eyes
And forget your name
Step outside yourself
And let your thoughts drain
As you go insane... [go] insane

[this verse has changed place with verse 3]
Inert flesh
A bloody tomb
A decorated splatter brightens the room
An execution a sadist ritual
Mad intervals of mind residuals

Close your eyes
Look deep in your soul
Step outside yourself
And let your mind go
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die

Close your eyes... and forget your name
Step outside yourself... and let your thoughts drain
As you go insane... [go] insane

[this verse has changed place with verse 2]
Innate seed
To watch you bleed
A demanding physical need
Desecrated, eviscerated
Times prostrated [sings ’perpetuated’]

(chorus)

Auschwitz, the meaning of pain
The way that I want you to die
Slow death, immense decay
Showers that cleanse you of your life
Forced in
Like cattle
You run
Stripped of
Your life’s worth
Human mice, for the angel of death
Four hundred thousand more to die
Angel of death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Sadistic, surgeon of demise
Sadist of the noblest blood

Destroying, without mercy
To benefit the aryan race

Surgery, with no anesthesia
Fell the knife pierce you intensely
Inferior, no use to mankind
Strapped down screaming out to die
Angel of death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher,
Angel of death

Pumped with fluid, inside your brain
Pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes
Burning flesh, drips away
Test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil
Frigid cold, cracks your limbs
How long can you last
In this frozen water burial?
Sewn together, joining heads
Just a matter of time
’til you rip yourselves apart
Millions laid out in their
Crowded tombs
Sickening ways to achieve
The holocaust
Seas of blood, bury life
Smell your death as it burns
Deep inside of you
Abacinate, eyes that bleed
Praying for the end of
Your wide awake nightmare
Wings of pain, reach out for you
His face of death staring down,
Your blood running cold
Injecting cells, dying eyes
Feeding on the screams of
The mutants he’s creating
Pathetic harmless victims
Left to die
Rancid angel of death
Flying free

(Rag Doll)

(Chorus)
Rag Doll, livin' in a movie
Hot tramp, daddy's little cutie
So fine, they'll never see ya
leavin' by the back door, man
Hot time, get it while it's easy
Don't mind, come on up and see me
Rag Doll, baby won't you do me
Like you done before

I'm feelin' like a bad boy
Mmm, just like a bad boy
I'm rippin' up a Rag Doll
Like throwing away an old toy
Some babe's talkin' real loud
Talkin' all about the new crowd
Try and sell me on an old dream
A new version of the old scene
Speak easy on the grape vine
Keep shufflin' in the shoe shine
Old tin lizzy, do it till you're dizzy
Give it all ya got until you're put out of your misery

(Chorus)

Yes, I'm movin', Yes I'm movin'
get ready for the big time
Tap dancing on a land mine
Yes I'm movin', Yes I'm movin'
Old tin lizzy, do it till you're dizzy
Give it all ya got until you're put out of your misery

(Chorus)
Baby won't you do me, baby won't you do me....
Like you done before (huh huh)

Yes, I'm movin', Yes I'm movin'
Get ready for the big time
Get crazy on the moonshine
Yes, I'm movin', I'm really movin'

Sloe gin fizzy
Do it till you're dizzy
Give it all you got until you're put out of your misery

(Repeat Chorus)
(Dude (Looks Like A Lady) - Permanent Vacation)

Cruised into a bar on the shore
He picture graced a grime on his door
She a long lost love at first sight
Baby, mabye you're wrong
But you know it's all right - that's right

Back stage we're having the time
Of our lives until somebody says
'Forgive me if I seem out of line'
Then she whipped out a gun
Tried to blow me away

(Choruse)
Dude Looks Like A Lady
Dude Looks Like A Lady
Dude Looks Like A Lady
Dude Looks Like A Lady

So never judge a book by its cover
Or who you gonna love by your lover
Love put me wise to her love in disguise
She had the body of a venus
Lord, imagine my surprise

(Chorus)

(Baby let me follow you down)
Let me take a peak dear
(Baby let me follow you down)
Do me, do me, do me all night
(Baby let me follow you down)
Turn the other cheek dear
(Baby let me follow you down)
Do me, do me, do me, sue me

What a funky lady
Oh, she like it, like it, like it, like it
Oh, he was a lady

(Repeat Chorus)

(Amazing - Get A Grip)

I kept the right ones out
And let the wrong ones in
Had an angel of mercy 
To see me through all my sins
There were times in my life
When I was goin' insane
Tryin' to walk through the pain

And when I lost my grip
And I hit the floor
Yeah, I tought I could leave
But couldn't get out the door 
I was so sick n' tired
Of livin' a lie
I was wishing that I would die

(Chorus)
It's amazing
With the blink of an eye
You finally see the light
It's amazing
That when the moment arrives
You know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm saying a prayer
for the desperate hearts tonight

That one last shot's a Permanent Vacation
And a how high can you fly with broken wings
Life's a journey - not a destination
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings

You have to learn to crawl
Before you learn to walk
But I just couldn't listen 
To all that righteous talk
I was out on the street
Just tryin' to survive
Scratchin' to stay alive

(Chorus)

Under My Skin
(Tyler, Perry, Frederiksen, Hudson) 

You breathe 
I breathe you in
I like a lot where you been
I make, you break the rule
You got e-rot-tickle cool

Give a little bit
Get a little bit
Take it for a ride yeah
When you push love so far away, it eats you up inside
There's a girl living under my skin
There's this girl and she's wearing me thin
And I think she's the reason
That it's open broken hearted season

There's a girl there's a girl

I know you know you are
You are the oo in la la
Blow a little kiss
Know a little bliss
Get a little high yeah
And I can't get you out of me, 'cause you're too deep inside

There's a girl living under my skin
There's this girl and she's wearing me thin
And I think she's the reason
That it's open broken hearted season

You could spend your whole lifetime
Under my skin
You could be never more mine

There's a girl there's a girl
There's a girl there's a girl

Get a little bit
Give a little bit
Get little high yeah
When you push love so far away it eats you up inside

There's a girl living under my skin
There's this girl and she's wearing me thin
And I think she's the reason
That it's open broken hearted season

Trapped in purgatory
A lifeless object, alive
Awaiting reprisal
Death will be their acquisition

The sky is turning red
Return to power draws near
Fall into me, the sky’s crimson tears
Abolish the rules made of stone

Pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past
Betrayed by many, now ornaments dripping above

Awaiting the hour of reprisal
Your time slips away

Raining blood
From a lacerated sky
Bleeding it’s horror
Creating my structure
Now I shall reign in blood!
I don't want to miss a thing (?)

I could stay awake just to hear you breathing,
Watch you smile while you are sleeping,
While you are far away and dreaming,
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender,
I could stay lost in this moment forever,
Where a moment spent with you is a moment I treasure,

(Chorus)
I don't want to close my eyes, I don't want to fall asleep,
Cause I miss you baby, And I don't want to miss a thing,
Cause even when I dream of you, the sweetest dream will never do,
I still miss you baby and I don't want to miss a thing

Lying close to you feeling your heart beating,
And I wondering what you are dreaming,
Wondering if it's me you are seeing,
Then I kiss your eyes and thank god we're together,
I just want to stay with you in this moment forever and forever forever

(Chorus)

And I don't want to miss one smile,
I don't want to miss one kiss,
I just want to be with you right here with you,
Just like this, I just want to hold you close,
I feel your heart so close to mine
And just stay here in this moment,
For all of the rest of time

(Chorus)

Kings And Queens



Long ago in days I'm told
Were ruled by Lords of greed
Maidens fared with gold they dared
To bare their wombs that bleed
Kings and queens and guillotines
Taking lives denied
Starch and parchment laid the laws
When bishops took the ride
Only to deceive

Oh I know I lived this life afore
Somehow know now truths I must be sure
Tossin, turnin' nightmares burnin'
Dreams of swords in hand
Sailin' ships the Viking spits
The blood of father's land
Only to deceive

Living times of knights and mares
Raising swords for maidens fair
Sneer at death
Fear only loss of pride

Living other centuries
Deja vu or what you please
Follows true to all who do or die

Screams of no reply
They died
Screams of no reply
And died
Lordy Lordy they died
Lordy Lordy they died

Live and do or die
They died
Live and no reply
They died
Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion

You talk about things that nobody cares
You’re wearing out things that nobody wears
You’re calling my name but you gotta make clear
I can’t say baby where I’ll be in a year

Some sweat hog mama with a face like a gent
Said my get up and go musta got up and went
Well I got good news, she’s a real good liar
’cause the backstage boogie set your pants on fire

Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion

I pulled into town in a police car
Your daddy said I took it just a little to far
You’re telling me things but your girlfriend lied
You can’t catch me ’cause the rabbit gone died
Yes it is

You stand in the front just a shakin’ your ass
I’ll take you backstage, you can drink from my glass
I talk about somehting you can sure understand
’cause a month on the road an’ I’ll be eating from your hand

Uh-huh,
Life's like this
Uh-huh, uh-huh
That's the way it is
'Cause life's like this
Uh-huh, uh-huh
That's the way it is


Chill out,
What you yellin' for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be
You will see


I like you the way you are
When we're, driving in my car
And you're talking to me
One on one
But you become


Somebody else
'Round everyone else
Watchin' your back
Like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool
You look like a fool
To me


Tell me


Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Acting like you're somebody else gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you
And you fall and you crawl
And you break and you take
What you get and you turn it into
Honesty Promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it


No, no, no


You come over unannounced
Dressed up like you're something else
Where you are and
Where you sat, you see
You're making me
Laugh out
When you strike a pose
Take off all your preppy clothes
You know
You're not fooling anyone
When you become


Somebody else
'Round everyone else
Watchin' your back
Like you can't relax
Tryin' to be cool
You look like a fool
To me


Tell me


Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Acting like you're somebody else gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you
And you fall and you crawl
And you break and you take
What you get and you turn it into
Honesty Promise me
I'm never gonna find you fake it


No, no, no...


Chill out,
What you yellin' for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could let it be
You will see


Somebody else
'Round everyone else
You're watchin' your back
Like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool
You look like a fool
To me, to me


Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Acting like you're somebody else gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you
And you fall and you crawl
And you break and you take
What you get and you turn it into
Honesty Promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it


No, no


Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Acting like you're somebody else gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you
And you fall and you crawl
And you break and you take
What you get and you turn it into
Honesty Promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it 
You held my hand and walked me home I know
While you gave me that kiss it was something like this it made me go ooh ohh
You wiped my tears, got rid of all my fears, why did you have to go?
Guess it wasn't enough to take up some of my love
Guys are so hard to trust
Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl?
The one who gives it all away

[Chorus:]
Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time?
Did you think that it was somethin I was gonna do and cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do,
Dont try to tell me what to say,
Your better off that way

Don't think that your charm and the fact that your arm is now around my neck
Will get you in my pants I'll have to kick your ass and make you never forget
I'm gonna ask you to stop, thought I liked you a lot, but I'm really upset
Get out of my head get off of my bed yeah thats what I said
Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl, the one who, throws it all away

[Chorus]
Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time?
Did you think that it was somethin I was gonna do and cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do,
Dont try to tell me what to say,
Your better off that way

This guilt trip that you put me on won't, mess me up I've done no wrong
Any thoughts of you and me have gone away

[Chorus]
Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time?
Did you think that it was somethin I was gonna do and cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do,
Dont try to tell me what to say,
Your better off that way

Better off that way
I'm better off alone anyway 

	So much for my happy ending
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...

Let's talk this over
It's not like we're dead
Was it something I did?
Was it something You said?
Don't leave me hanging
In a city so dead
Held up so high
On such a breakable thread

You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be

[Chorus:]
You were everything, everything that I wanted
We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it
And all of the memories, so close to me, just fade away
All this time you were pretending
So much for my happy ending
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...

You've got your dumb friends
I know what they say
They tell you I'm difficult
But so are they
But they don't know me
Do they even know you?
All the things you hide from me
All the shit that you do

You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be

[Chorus]

It's nice to know you were there
Thanks for acting like you cared
And making me feel like I was the only one
It's nice to know we had it all
Thanks for watching as I fall
And letting me know we were done

[Chorus x2]

[x2]
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...
So much for my happy ending

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...
Kiss me
out of the bearded barly
nightly
beside the green green grass
swing swing (swing swing)
swing the spinning step
you wear those shoes and
i will wear that dress.

ohhhh......
(chorus)
kiss me
beneath the milky twilight
lead me
out on the moonlit floor,
lift your open hand
strike up the band and
make the fog lights dance
silver moon sparkling.
So, kiss me.

Kiss me (kiss me)
Down by the broken treehouse
Swing me (swing me)
upon it's hanging tire,
Bring bring (bring bring)
bring your flowerhat
we'll take the trail marked on your
father's map, ohhhhh

(chorus)

OHHH....kiss me
beneath the milky twilight
lead me
out on the moonlit floor,
lift your open hand
strike up the band and
make the fog lights dance
silver moon sparkling.
So, kiss me.

So, kiss me.

So, kiss me.

(lalala lalala)

So, kiss me.


I couldn't tell you why she felt that way,
She felt it everyday.
And I couldn't help her,
I just watched her make the same mistakes again.

What's wrong, what's wrong now?
Too many, too many problems.
Don't know where she belongs, where she belongs.
She wants to go home, but nobody's home.
It's where she lies, broken inside.
With no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes.
Broken inside.

Open your eyes and look outside, find the reasons why.
You've been rejected, and now you can't find what you left behind.
Be strong, be strong now.
Too many, too many problems.
Don't know where she belongs, where she belongs.
She wants to go home, but nobody's home.
It's where she lies, broken inside.
With no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes.
Broken inside.

Her feelings she hides.
Her dreams she can't find.
She's losing her mind.
She's fallen behind.
She can't find her place.
She's losing her faith.
She's fallen from grace.
She's all over the place.
Yeah,oh

She wants to go home, but nobody's home.
It's where she lies, broken inside.
With no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes.
Broken inside.

She's lost inside, lost inside...oh oh yeah
She's lost inside, lost inside...oh oh yeah
